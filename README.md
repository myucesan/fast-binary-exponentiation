# Fast Binary Exponentiation
**Note that this implementation is unfinished.**

Implement the function `computeC(int[] a, int[] b)`, which takes an array a of length 𝑛
and an array b of length 𝑚
as input and returns an 𝑛×𝑚
matrix. This matrix contains the values $𝑎_i^{b_j}$
, where $𝑎_𝑖$
is the 𝑖
-th value in array a and $𝑏_𝑗$
is the 𝑗
-th value in array b.

In this exercise you are not allowed to use Math.pow() and should implement fast binary exponentiation by yourself.
